# Custorium
"Custorium" is a merge of the words "Custodio" and and "storium" (a neologism derived from "storage") so could be explained as  "Storage I control"

## Project goal
For now it is a playground to explore different techniques and protocols currently in use or in development for personal / organisational storages and data spaces. 

The ultimate goal is to create a Linked data based (hybrid) personal or organisational storage possibly implementing different (more or less compatible)  protocols.

Things being looked at are

 * [Solid project](https://solidproject.org/)
 * [NGSI-LD](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.07.01_60/gs_CIM009v010701p.pdf)
